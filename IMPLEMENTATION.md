# Keepr Web - Login & Home Screen

## What's Been Created

I've successfully created a login screen and a tentative home screen for your Keepr web application with the following features:

### 🔐 Login Screen (`src/views/LoginView.vue`)
- **Beautiful gradient design** with purple theme
- **Email and password authentication** using Supabase
- **Login and Sign up functionality** (toggle between modes)
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Responsive design** that works on mobile and desktop
- **Loading states** during authentication

### 🏠 Home Screen (`src/views/HomeView.vue`)
- **Clean, modern dashboard** with professional styling
- **Header with user email** and logout button
- **Welcome section** with greeting
- **Quick action cards** for:
  - 📝 New Note
  - 📚 My Notes
  - 🏷️ Categories
  - 🔍 Search
- **Recent notes section** (ready for when you add note functionality)
- **Responsive grid layout**
- **Empty state** for when no notes exist yet

### 🛣️ Routing (`src/router/index.js`)
- Vue Router setup with authentication guards
- Protected routes that require login
- Automatic redirect to login if not authenticated
- Automatic redirect to home if already logged in

## How to Use

1. **Start the development server** (already running):
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

2. **Open your browser** to:
   - Local: http://localhost:8081/

3. **Create an account**:
   - Click "Sign up" on the login page
   - Enter your email and password
   - Check your email for confirmation link

4. **Login**:
   - Enter your credentials
   - You'll be redirected to the home screen

5. **Explore**:
   - View your dashboard
   - Try the quick action cards (they show alerts for now)
   - Logout to return to the login screen

## Next Steps

To make this fully functional, you should:

1. **Create a notes table in Supabase**:
   ```sql
   create table notes (
     id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
     user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
     title text not null,
     content text,
     preview text,
     created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
     updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
   );
   ```

2. **Enable Row Level Security (RLS)** in Supabase:
   ```sql
   alter table notes enable row level security;
   
   create policy "Users can view their own notes"
     on notes for select
     using (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   create policy "Users can insert their own notes"
     on notes for insert
     with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   create policy "Users can update their own notes"
     on notes for update
     using (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   create policy "Users can delete their own notes"
     on notes for delete
     using (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```

3. **Implement note creation, editing, and viewing** features

4. **Add categories and tags** functionality

5. **Implement search** functionality
